          <p><span>Robert Manolis:</span>"Simply put, Athena is absolutely awesome! She is in the top one percent of students when it comes to commitment, dedication, and a contagious joy and appreciation for web development and learning. Her front end skills, including CSS, Sass, React and client side JavaScript, are solid and comprehensive. And her soft skills are about as good as it gets. She is a joy to work with, always upbeat and friendly, and quick to reach out and lend a helping hand or an encouraging word of support to her teammates. She's not afraid to ask for help when she needs it, and always seems passionate about learning more. Any team whose focus is doing great work and creating great user experiences would find itself extremely fortunate to count her among its assets."
          </p>

          <p><span>Randy Layne:</span>"Having been able to witness Athena in both the roles of student and mentor I can say that the cornerstone of which Athena is built on is passion. She displays it in everything she does. As a student she was passionate about learning how to become a web developer and her determination to go above and beyond the requirements for each project she produced. As a mentor to her fellow students and later as a contractor to be a Slack Moderator she again displayed passion, this time in the form of caring about the development and learning experience of the students in the Front End Web Development Techdegree at Treehouse. Not only would Athena be a valuable asset based on her actual programming abilities, but also in the areas of raising the whole level of a team based on her humbleness in embracing things she may not know yet, her ability to learn those things quickly, and her eagerness in sharing what she has learned with other members who may not yet understand the topic."
          </p>

          <p><span>Nicole Peery:</span>"I've had the pleasure of not only working side-by-side with Athena at Treehouse, but being a Techdegree student under her tutelage as well. When I was a student, I was impressed by Athena's ability to be helpful and point me in the right direction without giving me all the answers. As a coworker, she's always there when I have a question or need a second pair of eyes on things. Athena is professional, but she's not afraid to provide comic relief when the need arises. She's always trying something new, and is an ace at everything from JavaScript to jewelry making. I heartily recommend Athena as a teacher, front-end developer, and fellow student."</p>
